  <p>Splatware goes on show later this month as part of the​ ​London Design Festival 2017​. It features a range of marbled​ ​ceramics​ that are made by placing clay into plaster moulds. </p>
  <p>Each product is created by combining different coloured clays that have been sprayed with ceramic oxides and pressed – or "squished", as Assemble's Lewis Jones puts it – using an industrial RAM Press. This process introduces an element of chance to the production line – the squishing process can produce millions of different variations, so results in one-of-a-kind products that offer an alternative the uniformity of man-made items.</p> -->

<h2>Introduction</h2>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>To stoneware clay, we add varying amounts of ceramic pigments. Separate pieces of the colorful clays are placed together in a mould and compressed with 60 tonnes of pressure. This mixes and bonds the different colours together and forces the excess moisture out of the clay. The pieces are stamped, de-moulded, dried, carefully trimmed and cleaned before their first kiln firing to 1000 degrees.</p>
<p>They’re then sanded, glazed and re-fired to 1250 to reach full hardness. It’s a blend of precision craft and backyard science that has taken a great deal of trial and error to perfect.</p>

<ul>
    <li>"The act of making them is part of the creative process," Jones told Dezeen. "The process needs to invite chance and accident in a way of making that, for the maker, is more interesting because you don't know how it's going to turn out."</li>
    <li>"We try to avoid the monotony of batch production, which also means that for the people buying the products, they're one of a kind," said Jones.</li>
</ul>
